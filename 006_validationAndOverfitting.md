## Validation and Overfitting

### 1. Concept of Validation and Overfitting

In a nutshell validation is about proofing that a model can be applied to new data. Its about the model quality.

Overfitting in **"real world":** If the quality of the test set is worse than on the training set.
Overfitting in **"competition":** If the quality on the private test set is worse than on the training set.
